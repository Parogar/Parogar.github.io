</head>
<h1>This is the second lab for CSC 225</h1>
<p>I'm an "upper senior" student at CSI studying Computer Science. In order to complete my degree, I need 2 more credits in CS electives<br/>I decided to take
CSC 225 because after years of learning to code and working in the industry, I realize I can't even make a website!</p>
<h1> Things I hope to learn from this class</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>How to make websites that look really nice and have style and flair.</b></li>
    <li><b>How to use javascript to make them more interactable and fun to use.</b></li>
    <li><b>How to develop projects on a more professional scale.</b></l1>
    <li><b>I've also always been interested in CSS.</b></li>
</ul>
<h1>Courses I'm taking this semester</h1>

<p>Since this lab requires an image, I decided to generate an image using the new <b><i>INCREDIBLY</i></b>
powerful image generation model known as "Flux D." Since I have a 24gb RTX 4090, I run this locally, meaning I can generate as much
as I want without ever having to pay anyone! (<i>except the electric company)</i></p>
<p>Just in case you're interested in image gen AI, you can actually learn all about it <a href = "https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"><b>here</b></a></p>
